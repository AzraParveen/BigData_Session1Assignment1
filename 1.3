1.3>Horizontal Scaling and Vertical Scaling

Horizontal Scaling and Vertical Scaling

>Horizontal Scaling : When we add more servers with less RAM and processors, it is known as horizontal scaling. 
It can also be defined as the ability to increase the capacity by connecting multiple software or hardware 
entities in such a manner that they function as a single logical unit. It is cheaper as a whole and it can 
literally scale infinitely, however, there are some limits imposed by software or other attributes of an 
environmentâ€™s infrastructure. When the servers are clustered, the original server is scaled out horizontally. 
If a cluster requires more resources to improve its performance and provide high availability, then the 
administrator can scale-out by adding more servers to the cluster.

>Vertical Scaling : It refers to the process of adding more physical resources such as memory, storage and CPU 
to the existing database server for improving the performance. Vertical scaling helps in upgrading the capacity 
of the existing database server. It results in a robust system.It consumes less power as compared to running
multiple servers,Cooling costs are lesser than horizontal scaling.
