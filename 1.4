1.4>Need and Working of Hadoop

Hadoop is  a way of storing enormous data sets across distributed clusters of servers and then running “distributed”
analysis applications in each cluster.It’s designed to be robust, in that your Big Data applications will continue 
to run even when individual servers — or clusters — fail. And it’s also designed to be efficient, because it doesn’t
require your applications to shuttle huge volumes of data across your network.
The Hadoop software library is a framework that allows for the distributed processing of large data sets across 
clusters of computers using simple programming models. It is designed to scale up from single servers to thousands
of machines, each offering local computation and storage. Rather than rely on hardware to deliver high-availability,
the library itself is designed to detect and handle failures at the application layer, so delivering a highly 
available service on top of a cluster of computers, each of which may be prone to failures.
