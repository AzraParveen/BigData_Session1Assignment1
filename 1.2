1.2>3 V's of Big Data 

3 V's of Big Data are:
3 V's (volume, variety and velocity) are three defining properties or dimensions of big data.

1> Volume : Volume refers to the amount of data.The size of available data has been growing at an increasing rate.
This applies to companies and to individuals. A text file is a few kilo bytes, a sound file is a few mega bytes while
a full length movie is a few giga bytes.More sources of data are added on continuous basis. For companies, in the old 
days,all data was generated internally by employees. Currently, the data is generated by employees, partners and customers.
For a group of companies, the data is also generated by machines. For example, Hundreds of millions of smart phones 
send a variety of information to the network infrastructure. This data did not exist five years ago.
More sources of data with a larger size of data combine to increase the volume of data that has to be analyzed.
Peta byte data sets are common these days and Exa byte is not far away.

2> Variety : Variety refers to the data sources.Data can be stored in multiple formats.for exp. data can be in form of
document,media,sensor etc.From excel tables and databases, data structure has changed to loose its structure and to add
hundreds of formats. Pure text, photo, audio, video, web, GPS data, sensor data, relational data bases, documents, SMS,
pdf, flash, etc etc etc. One no longer has control over the input data format. Structure can no longer be imposed like
in the past in order to keep control over the analysis. As new applications are introduced new data formats come to life.

3>Velocity : Initially, companies analyzed data using a batch process. One takes a chunk of data, submits a job to 
the server and waits for delivery of the result. That scheme works when the incoming data rate is slower than the
batch processing rate and when the result is useful despite the delay. With the new sources of data such as social 
and mobile applications, the batch process breaks down. The data is now streaming into the server in real time,
in a continuous fashion and the result is only useful if the delay is very short.
